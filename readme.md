# Role2 Collaboration Standards

[Role2 Developer Collaboration Standards](./developer/index.md)

```text
scope: All collaboration scenarios
```

## Principle

**Goal-oriented. Everything is oriented towards achieving the goal.**

### Goal-oriented

What is a goal? Goal is defined as **bringing something to a certain state**, which requires effort in most cases.

#### Principle

**Small goals follow big goals**

A big goal is the current goal's parent goal. For instance, eat well and sleep well are sub-goals of survive; shop grocery and boil the water could be sub-goals of cooking. If a goal contradicts to its sub-goals, then those sub-goals are considered as invalid and should be discarded.

#### Format

Every goal must be an imperative sentence, meaning that the goal shall **include verb(s)**:

- **Submit** website filings (✔)
- **Implement** entry of admin page (✔)
- **Understand and record** customers' concerns (✔)
- Website filings (×)
- Entry of admin page (×)
- Customers' concerns (×)

#### Who can specify the goal (task)

Everyone. As long as the goal can be proved to be necessary.

Necessary goals: sub-goals that are essential to larger goals.

## Requirements

- Divide the tasks accurately
- Broadcast the status timely

### Divide the tasks

Requirements:

- **Feasable for a single person**: each smaller task can be completed by a single person.

#### Feasable for a single person

A task being feasable for a single person means the individual who was assigned to this goal can actually achieve it, either by completing it on his own (e.g. a developer role) or dividing it appropriately (e.g. a manager role).

### Broadcast in time

Broadcasting your progress is very important. Everyone sticking to their own tasks seems to be fine, but that could also make everyone become a blackbox. Broadcast incorrectly or no broadcasting at all could significantly increase the effort required for collaboration as well as the uncertainty of the project. On the other hand, accurate and timely broadcast enables everyone to take actions in the same context, which contributes to the overall efficiency.

让队友知道自己的状态。例如：

- 我在干什么（"已经到客户公司了，正在等客户开完会"）
- 顺不顺利（"客户觉得价格有点高"）
- 需不需要帮助？什么帮助？（"@whh，我们有没有开发数据分析的模块？"）
- 我的预期（"感觉客户有兴趣，明天我在问问"）
- 我在等哪个条件的满足（"让客户考虑两天"）
