## Collaboration

**Push whenever you can.**

Not doing so means teammates cannot know or refer to your latest progress, resulting in an information blackbox which affects everyone's anticipation and blocks the process.

What is pushable: as long as it runs without fatal error, it is pushable. It doesn't need to be perfect and bugs can exist. As for which branch to push, please refer to [Git > Banches](#Branches) section.
